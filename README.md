# WordPress Docker

WordPress Docker composition for local development.

This composition is designed for a quick and dirty local installation of a WordPress website duplicated with the Duplicator plugin.

## Configuration

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to adjust the composition to your needs.

### PHP Version

There are several images available for different PHP versions. Compare [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/poljpocket/wordpress). Set `image` of the `web` container to the appropriate PHP version.

### User configuration

Set `WEB_USER_ID` and `WEB_GROUP_ID` in `docker-compose.yml` to the appropriate values for your local user (on most Linux installations, the first user has ID `1000`). You can use `id` to verify.

### Persistence level

By default, the `docker-compose.yml` file will persist the database and the files as volumes to allow for multiple runs of the same installation. You can tweak this to be even more temporary and simplify the clean-up (see below).

## Running the composition

Place the `installer.php` and the archive (`.dup` or `.zip`) into the `backup` folder.

Run `docker compose up -d` to run the composition.

Go to http://localhost:8080/installer.php and go through the installation process as normal. When asked for database credentials, use `database` as host, and `docker` for user, password and database name.

After the installation, a `copied` file will be placed into the `backup` folder to mark that the files have been copied into the container. This will prevent further runs from copying the files again.

## Clean-up

You can use one single installation of this repository for multiple runs of different archives. To clean up, stop the composition and clear the `backup`, `themes` and `plugins` folders.

If you are using default persistence (see above), remove the `files` and `database` volumes Docker created to have a clean slate again.

## Advanced usage

For convenience, the `themes` and `plugins` directories will be mapped to the local filesystem.

You can view/edit the database with phpMyAdmin on http://localhost:8081.

After installation is done, you can remap single folders in the `themes` and `plugins` directories to allow local development. You can, for example, remove the folder `my_theme` in `themes` and clone it's actual git repository into the `themes` folder. This allows you to work on the code whilst running it as part of the WordPress installation locally.
